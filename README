VERSION 1.0

Pytypespeed is a script to compute a user's average typing speed in words per minute. Using a prompt, the user will begin to retype the
prompt, initializing a timer, and then, when done, the average words per minute will be reproduced along with error margin. 

TODO:
	Save to file to make a "scoreboard"
	Have players login to see their different scores
	Check to see if the prompt is actually completed.
	Have multiple prompts
	Have time in seconds
	Add comments to code
