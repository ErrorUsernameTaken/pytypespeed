VERSION 1.0

Pytypespeed is a script to compute a user's average typing speed in words per minute. Using a prompt, the user will begin to retype the
prompt, initializing a timer, and then, when done, the average words per minute will be reproduced along with error margin. 

TODO:
	Check to see if the prompt is actually completed (might need pynput)
	New accuracy system
	Add a difficulty setting (easy/advanced)
	Have the reader choose how many words they want to type
	Add sudden death mode (one mistake and the prompt ends)
	Make it work. Just make it work.

Failed TODOs:
These TODOs were supposed to be done, but I gave up on them. They were just too complex for my pea brain to handle.
	Disabling backspaces (why has nobody done aNYTHING for disabling keys)
