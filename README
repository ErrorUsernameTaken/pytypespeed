VERSION 1.0

"Pytypespeed is a script to compute a user's average typing speed in words per minute. Using a prompt, the user will begin to retype the
prompt, initializing a timer, and then, when done, the average words per minute will be reproduced along with error margin." - Dberko 2012
or something I can't be bothered to check 

Let's try this again, shall we? :^)

TODO:
	Check to see if the prompt is actually completed
	Disable backspaces (possibly the enter key too, to prevent premature "completion")
	Properly factor errors into accuracy
	Have the user choose word difficulty (average or advanced)
	If words, have the user choose a certain amount of words (50-1000)
